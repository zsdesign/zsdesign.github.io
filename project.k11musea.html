<div class="scontent lazy wow animated fadeIn">
<div class="pure-u-1"> 
<h5>Initial Stage</h5>
<p> 
The Nature Discovery Park is Hong Kong’s first urban biodiversity museum and sustainability-themed education park located in the newly opened K11 Musea in Tsim Sha Tsui.We first did initial research to know the outline and basic situation of NDP.</p>
<br>

<div class="scontent lazy wow animated fadeIn">
<div class="pure-u-1"> 
<h5>Case Study</h5>

<p>
We examined existing or similar business models, and similar sites which receive lots of attention. The criteria of selection is to have themes related to NDP’s core values, related operation methods as well as having interactive opportunities.
</p>


<p>
<b>Hong Kong Wetland Park</b>
<ul style="color: #555555;">
<li>Wetland park is one of the most iconic nature themed park in Hong Kong. Its mission is to raise public awareness and understanding of wetlands, as well as marshal their support for wetland conservation. The park is opened in May, 2006, where the ticket price for adult is HKD30 and half price for kids.</li>
<li>Inside the Wetland education centre, the museum area provides lots of interactive displays and games as well as knowledge-based gallery. Regular Workshops are held so that visitors are always getting involved and this could possibly drive recurring visits.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Hong Kong Science Museum Biodiversity Gallery</b>
<ul style="color: #555555;">
<li>Inside this display area, there are sever- al minigames and interactive exhibi- tions which allows visitors to know more about Hong Kong’s biodiversity through different senses (e.g. Vision, hear). Other examples include digital butterfly drawing as well as animal specimen. </li>
<li>Kids get involved easily with these displays,they are then being more engaged into the area, various senses also allows kids to create unforgettable memories.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>
<b>City Farm</b>
<ul style="color: #555555;">
<li>City Farm is a collection of rooftop farms around Hong Kong. The farm provides different organic planting courses as well as farm rentals. In this farm, people would be able to obtain essential farming skills and practicing in person.</li>
<li>As visitors would be able to practice farming in person, this could create opportunities to enhance interaction between parents and kids.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<br>
<h5>Marketing Position Comaparison</h5>
<p> 
Compared to other similar business models, NDP’s entrance fee is relatively high (tour), which is doubled to Wetland Park and triple to Science Museum, yet the depth of content we could find inside is limited and relatively not comprehensive.<br><br>
The displays found in the business models above have strong relationship with their core values, while current NDP can barely be related to the brand’s core value as well as local value.</p>
</div>

<div class="scontent lazy wow animated fadeIn">
<div class="pure-u-1"> 
<h5>KOL Research</h5>
<p>We collected 1404 users' data, contains age, interests, location, and gender, then visualizaed them. We found that the followers of HK K11 are mainly female millennials from Greater Bay Area, interested in making up and fashion. NDP shoule dig the balue of art and design to fashion and making up.</p>

<div class="scontent lazy wow animated fadeIn">
<div class="pure-u-1"> 
<h5>Initial Observation Research</h5>
<p>In order to be familiar with the potential customers distribution as well as understanding K11 Musea’s visitors behaviour, we conducted multiple visits to the K11 Musea on weekdays as well as weekend so as to observe such behaviour. Below is a quick summary of our observations:
<br><br>It is observed that most visitors are mainly young families
The visitors mainly went shopping and took photos inside the K11 Musea, where some of them prefer staying at indoor green areas with interactive installations.
<br><br>
<b>Key Findings</b>: There is a lack of signature or representable icons in K11 Musea’s green areas, where people may not be able to related to. As for Nature Discovery Park, one of the major concerns is that people might not be able to recognize NDP easily in the photos taken, and this could possibly lead to fewer attention or creating less promotion value to NDP.

<h5>Current Trend in Social Media Analysis</h5>
<p>
For the challenge "How to develop a viral social media campaign?", our team also analyzed the current forms of social media development.
<br><br>

<b>Short Video Apps</b>: The short video industry is still growing rapidly, with nearly 100 million new customers installed in June 2019. (example: Tik Tok ) The number of monthly active users of the vibrato has exceeded 500 million. It has maintained rapid growth in the domestic and foreign markets. The main user group :aged 24 to 30 (exceeded 40%),
<br><br>

<b>Social Networks</b>: Various social software widely used in people's daily life. Sharing all kinds of info (tasted food/famous scenery/amazing movies/makeup/...) becomes an indispensable part of life.
<br><br>

<b>Vlog(video weblog/video blog)</b>: A type of video created by an individual,freestyle. 
<ul style="color: #555555; padding-bottom: 5pt;">
<li>Vlog shooting base on daily life.</li>
<li>Spread with high speed.</li>
<li>Funny content and strong sense of rhythm</li>
<li>Popular in the younger generation.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>AR(Augmented Reality)/Online Celebrity/Self-media/Idol Effect
</b>: The physical environment and virtual objects are superimposed in real time on the same picture or space.Vivid and interesting expressions stimulate the senses of the audience.
Since the rapid development of the self-media, the "online celebrity economy" has also developed in high speed.
Young idol celebrity endorsements have greatly helped to promote brand sale(s example:Burberry&Kris Wu)

<div class="scontent lazy wow animated fadeIn">
<div class="pure-u-1"> 
<h5>Initial Stage Conclusion</h5>
<p>For our initial direction corresponding to the two challenges, we summarized the following opportunities:</p>
<p>
<ul style="color: #555555; padding-bottom: 5pt;">
<li>Possibility to add interactive displays in NDP that echoes with K11’s brand value, so as to encourage social behaviours in both online and offline ways</li>
<li>Create sympathy with local culture so as to attract more visitors</li>
<li>NDP could reflect a more trendy image to further reinforce the core value of K11</li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="scontent lazy wow animated fadeIn">
<div class="pure-u-1"> 
<h5>Second Stage</h5>
<p>In this stage of the project we further investigate the value brought by Nature Discovery Park as well as in-depth understanding of the target customers’ demand. Through this stage, it is expected to perceive the intentions and expectations from our customers so that we could identify the value of Nature Discovery Park and match those values to potential visitors’ demand.</p>

<p>
Research methods are as follows:
<ul style="color: #555555; padding-bottom: 5pt;">
<li>Investigation in the K11 musea</li>
<li>User Journey Map</li>
<li>Empathy Map</li>
<li>Value Proposition Canvas</li>
<li>Interview</li>
<li>Questionnaire</li>
<li>Deeper Observation Research</li>
</p>
</div>

<div class="scontent lazy wow animated fadeIn">
<div class="pure-u-1"> 
<h5>Booking Flow of NDP and Revisitng to K11 Musea</h5>
<p>We further investigated the user experience of getting into the NDP inside K11 Musea. At the beginning, it is observed that the booking flow of the Green Tour could be confusing. During our observation, there were only a few indications and signs inside K11 Musea to promote NDP. Inside the elevator, the signs are unclear towards the potential customers, as the sequence of floor buttons is different between each side of the door.</p>
<p><b>Key Findings</b>: customers left as soon as they noticed that they had to pay for the visit. It’s boring while waiting for the collection.
Directions for NDP is unclear (Lift design, signs).</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="scontent lazy wow animated fadeIn">
<div class="pure-u-1"> 
<h5>Positioning</h5>
<p>The purpose of revisiting the role and positioning of Nature
Discovery Park is to discover the advantages of NDP internally
(Under K11 brand) and externally (Similar business in the market).</p>

<h5>Target Customer Analysis</h5>
<p>
At this stage, we use a variety of research methods to determine the target customer group of NDP. At the same time, we conduct a more comprehensive analysis of target customers’ potential demands.<br><br>
</p>

<h5>Questionnaire</h5>
<p>To determine the target customer group and their demands, our team conducted a questionnaire at K11 musea on weekend.

<div class="scontent lazy wow animated fadeIn">
<div class="pure-u-1"> 
<h5>Empathy Map</h5>
<p>An empathy map is a collaborative tool teams can use to gain a deeper insight into our customers.
Combined with the previous questionnaire and interviews result, our team consider a mother with two children as “persona”.We discussed and summarized her thoughts and emotions from "what does she think and what worried her" "what does she hear and see" "what does she say and do" four aspects.</p>

<div class="scontent lazy wow animated fadeIn">
<div class="pure-u-1"> 
<h5>Value Proposition Canvas</h5>
<p>Based on the analysis of persona's empathy map, we use design tools Value Proposition Canvas (as short for“VPC”) helps to design, test, and build NDP’s value proposition to match with customers needs in a more structured way.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="lcontent lazy wow animated fadeIn">

<div class="scontent lazy wow animated fadeIn">
<div class="pure-u-1"> 
<h5>User Journey Map</h5>
<p>During the questionnaire process, our team met a parent who had visited NDP . In order to better understand the customer's emotional changes from planning to visiting the NDP, and find out the customer’s pain points, we interviewed the parent to understand his thoughts, emotions, and motivations throughout the process. Using the “journey map” design tool to map out a customer’s timeline experience of NDP, which helps us find out the pain points of the customer experience and provide opportunities for subsequent design and optimization.</p>

<div class="pure-u-1"> 
<h5>Opportunities and Insights</h5>
<p>After the research stage, our team concluded the opportunities and insights below. To conclude, the mapping of internal positioning of Nature Discovery Park revealed that the nature concept as well as the interaction features of NDP could potentially be the advantages among other K11 activities and workshops. Moreover, in terms of the external positioning of Nature Discovery Park, it is discovered that there are quite a lot of similar business models in the market, where the market could be potentially saturated, while having both indoor and outdoor environment for the visitors could potentially meet the young family visitors demand. Our insights are then generated based on matching these internal and external advantages of Nature Discovery Park to the target customers’ demand.</p>

<p>
<b>Internal</b>
<ul style="color: #555555;">
<li>Optimizing whole process for better engagement Booking, tour, content.</li>
<li>Clearer positioning & Enhance current features Strengthen the nature+sustainability value</li>
<li>Incorporating more interaction to attract customers plant+observe+record</li>
<li>edutainment+cognition nature (Quarterly theme event...) integrating higher technology</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>External</b>
<ul style="color: #555555;">
<li>Establish brand value and image to boost customers’ intention to visit
</li>
<li>Embrace the benefits of being part of a whole ecosystem of K11 Musea.</li>
</ul>
</p>

</div>
</div>

<div class="lcontent lazy wow animated fadeIn">
<img class="pure-img" src="img/k11musea/16.jpg">
</div>

<div class="scontent lazy wow animated fadeIn">
<div class="pure-u-1"> 
<h5>Second Stage Conclusion</h5>
<p>Our team concluded to continuing identifying Nature Discovery Park’s value, understand more about the kids’ psychological needs, matching the value of NDP to the potential needs of customers and develop and test our insights.</p><br>

<h5>Redefine the value of Nature Discovery Park</h5>
<p>Based on the two challenges given, our group firstly redefine the value of Nature Discovery Park. We further summarized the young families with kids’ demands as follows:</p>

<p>
<ul style="color: #555555;">
<li>Let kids to be physically and mentally healthy, learn to observe and be passionate with their lives, be warm. </li>
<li>Master essential life skills through practical experience. </li>
<li>learn to get along with others and establish appropriate world view. </li>
<li>Enhance interaction and build up relationship.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Based on the result above and data collected from previous research stage, we categorized these findings into 4 major insights. It is observed that apart from expecting more interactions and education value when consider visiting certain venues, the young parents are also aware of the kids’ mental and physical health. They would also expect their kids to be able to master essential living skills. Apart from that, the bonding between parents and kids is also a major factor to consider. In addition, young parents would also potentially hope their children to develop cognition with nature and people.</p>

<p>
<ul style="color: #555555;">
<li>Enhance mental and physical health (Personal-value)</li>
<li>Master essential living skills (Personal value)</li>
<li>Strengthen the bonding between parents and kids (Social-value)</li>
<li>Develop cognition with nature and people (Social/Eco value)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<br>
<h5>Concept Ideation</h5>
<p>Based on the redefinition of NDP’s value, our team brainstorm some new concepts for NDP . It produces the following six concepts and ideations as follow:</p>

</div>
</div>

<div class="lcontent lazy wow animated fadeIn">
<img class="pure-img" src="img/k11musea/17.jpg">
</div>

<div class="scontent lazy wow animated fadeIn">
<div class="pure-u-1"> 
<h5>Filtering</h5>
<p>After brainstorming six concepts and produced some ideations, our team group used the “UTB Filter” tool to assign the above six concepts from the three levels of “User, Business, Technology” and 30 subdivision indicators. The goal is to filter the most ideal and most feasible concept. Some details as follow:</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="lcontent lazy wow animated fadeIn">
<img class="pure-img" src="img/k11musea/18.jpg">
</div>

<div class="scontent lazy wow animated fadeIn">
<div class="pure-u-1"> 
<h5>Solution Development</h5>
<p>Our group started a lively discussion for the concept "live like a living being". How can we achieve the goal of "live like a living being", what does it look like as a ‘ human being’? We gradually become numb in the intense daily life, only focusing on the electronic devices and neglecting the real world around us. People become indifferent, and people and nature become opposite. We believe that it is very necessary to stay away from the busy reality and return to nature to rethink the relationship between ourselves and nature. The NDP should be further developed into a space that inspires people to re-examine the reality, and experience the purest beauty in the simplest way.</p> <br>
<h5>Ideation</h5>

<div class="scontent lazy wow animated fadeIn">
<div class="pure-u-1"> 
<h5>Final Solution</h5>
<p>Our final solution is a package for our customers to connect with NDP and fully enjoy and experience the changing of nature. Hong Kong is a fast-paced and crowded international city that people live with huge pressures and stress. Living in urban environment has always made people ignoring their surroundings as well as the perception of nature. Nature Discovery Park provides the perfect spot for urban citizens to revisit the beauty of nature in Hong Kong and reflect human’s most basic living essence. There are 6 keywords which would be the core elements of the solutions, namely 4 season, 5 sense, well being, bonding, health and harmony. The solution can be separated into the following parts: The 4 season 5 sense Journey, Pricing Strategies and Promotion Strategies refinement.</p>

<h5>The 4 season 5 sense Journey</h5>
<p>This journey is a collection of activities, games and workshops that inspires visitors to experience the charm of nature in 4 seasons with 5 senses in the most natural and simplistic way. Through this journey, they would be able to get relaxed and have a chance to talk to themselves and be connected to the nature.</p>
<br>
<h5>Intention of design</h5>
<p>There are 4 core intention that this journey would be able to achieve: inspire thinking, pay attention to and observe the surrounding world, appreciate the beauty of nature and cultivate the sentiment. In the following, Autumn is used as an example for the possible details that could be developed inside the journey.</p>

<div class="scontent lazy wow animated fadeIn">
<div class="pure-u-1"> 
<h5>Seasonal Activity Example: A Date with Autumn</h5>
<p>The journey kicks off with the participants receiving an invitation letter from the season - “Autumn”. The participants would then be required to complete several tasks in exchange for a letter of completion. This achievement could then be developed as the trigger to viral social media sharing.</p>

<p>
<b>First Task: Listen and Smell</b>
<ul style="color: #555555;">
<li>Venue: Urban farm and Aquarium </li>
<li>Experience: Sound of sea+aroma of flower+sunlight experiencing</li>
<li>This task encourages children to pick up various shells locate by the aquarium to listen to the symphony created by the sound of waves. The kids would then have the chance to describe this sound to their parents. As the flowers are blooming beautifully in the open space of Nature Discovery Park, kids would be able to experience Autumn through the flower’s aroma and learn to pay more attention to the surroundings and discover. On the other hand, the “hearing” and “smell” senses can also arouse kids’ cognition to the nature.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Second Task: Vision and Touch (Nature Ingredients Treasure Hunting)</b>
<ul style="color: #555555;">
<li>Venue: Outdoor Open Space of Nature Discovery Park</li>
<li>Experience: Discover ingredients hidden around the park’s open area</li>
<li>After an initial understanding of the season through the sound of sea and aroma of flowers, the participants would then be able to experience more in-depth contents in the journey. In this activity, the kids would first receive a treasure ingredient list. As the treasure hunt for ingredients begins, kids will have to find out the ingredients located sepa- rately inside the park through the 5 sense hints provided on the list. Through the process, the children would be able to understand the ingredients’ characteris- tics through “vision” (observing the appearance of ingredients) and “touch” (feeling the texture of ingredients). In order to help the kids to be more engaged, a secret present will be given as a prize once they completed finding the ingredients.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Third Task: Taste and Share (Magic Kitchen)</b>
<ul style="color: #555555;">
<li>Venue: Activity Room</li>
<li>Experience: Preparing fresh vegetable salad, share the joy of tasting and slow cooking</li>
<li>The final activity would be to prepare salad based on the ingredients found in the previous treasure hunting activity. During the section, parents and kids would be able to learn how to prepare fresh salad in a more healthier way. Not only the kids can train up their practical skills, but also they can share their precious effort to make such healthy and delicious to their friends and parents.</li>
<li>At the end of this Autumn journey, the young parents and kids would be able to receive a letter of completion as an achievement. Through this whole Autumn journey, the parents are able to interact with their kids while enjoying the natural and relaxing environment provid- ed by Nature Discovery Park. As for the kids, through the simple yet fun 5-sense experiences, they would be able to be inspired to think more. The kids would also become more sensitive about the surroundings and ultimately build up their physical and mental healthiness.</li>

<h5>Promotion Strategies</h5>
<p>NDP will implement a series of strategy to build up consumers’ awareness and demands.It is estimated to be $10,000 per month in promoting investment.The specific plan is as follows:</p>
<br>
<h5>Eco-leaflets and Seedling</h5>
<p>In terms of promotion, one of the most straightforward and direct ways is through leaflets and flyers. Inside K11 Musea, multiple leaflets could be found near elevators as well as other locations. As these leaflets are made from well-quality papers and printed with high-contrast colors, they are no doubt really eye catching towards the visitors in the K11 Musea. How- ever, as soon as the leaflet is being read the purpose of the leaflet is pretty much done and is destined to be thrown into recycling bins.</p>
<p>The idea behind this eco-leaflet is to maximize and optimize the usage of leaflet so as to promote NDP’s sustainable theme. The paper would be made from recycled materials and printed with monotone ink so as to echo with the environmentally friendly image of NDP. This leaflet could be folded into a simple pot through simple steps, the potential customers could then get to the front deck on 8/F to get soil and seed through simply check-in and share on social media. The pot could then be taken back home to grow a small seedling. This could potentially boost up social media spreading and help to promote NDP.</p>

<h5>Conclusion</h5>
<p>For the first challenge “How to drive recurring visits”, through “ 4 season 5 sense journey”, pricing strategies and interactive touch points, this solution provides more in-depth content for Nature Discovery Park to further attract potential customers. The seasonal themed journey acts as an opportunity for customers to continuously be aware of the upcoming events of NDP and potentially drive more recurring visits later on. The in-depth content of the journey also matches with young parents’ demands and Additionally, through the new pricing strategies, people’s intention to revisit the park would be increased, as the pricing package encourages people to partici- pate in different activities inside Nature Discovery Park.</p>

<p>In terms of the second challenge “How to develop a viral social media campaign”, the interactive touch points allow people to be more connected to NDP through a physical holographic installation, where the eco leaflets on the other hand promotes sustainability value through maximizing the usage as a leaflet. With the simple “Like and Share” action that was required in order to get the soil and seed from Nature Discovery Park front desk, the leaflet could be another trigger point to encourage people to share NDP to their friends and relatives, which ultimately increases the exposure of Nature Discovery Park in various social media and helps promoting NDP.</p>
